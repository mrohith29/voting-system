    <h1>Make your own vote</h1>    
    <p>
        So this is not the website if you think you can make <b> <u>dummy votes</u>  </b>to vote in the real public elections instead this will help you to perform your own elections in the local body like:
        <ul>
        <li>School for selecting the school captain </li>
        <li>In the office for the office president </li>
        <li> in your locality for who want to be the colony president</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <button id="nxtpg">
        Let's get Started
    </button>
</main>

<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#nxtpg').click(function() {
            window.location.href = 'info.html';
        });
    });
